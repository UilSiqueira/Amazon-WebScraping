# Amazon-WebScraping
Web Scraping and Python Repository<br>

Choose a product then this bot will scrap it from Amazon and save all the results with product name, price and link into excel sheet.<br>

*For better project exemples in my github, I intend to implement the best practices using OOP and design patterns, solid concepts and examples of asynchronous programming and data structures for performance.
